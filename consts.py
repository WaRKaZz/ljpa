   '{CV_TEXT}'
   
   
   A. Skills Matching (45% of total score):

   - Calculate: (Matching Skills / Required Skills) * 40
   - Give partial credit for similar/related skills
   
   B. Experience Level Match (35% of total score):
   - Compare required years of experience with CV
   - Calculate: (Candidate Years / Required Years) * 30
   - Cap at 30% even if candidate exceeds requirements
   
   C. Role Responsibilities Match (20% of total score):
   - Extract key responsibilities from job description
   - Compare with CV experience and achievements
   - Calculate: (Matching Responsibilities / Total Required) * 20

   Calculate Final Percentage:
   - Sum all category scores (A + B + C)
   - Round to nearest whole number
   - Always provide a percentage even if low match

'vacancy:[true]
cv_match:[70%]
vacancy_title:[Senior Controls Engineer]
